# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). 
# Multiple identifiers can be separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once).
# Examples:
#  "--disable=all" disable everything first and then reenable specific checks.
#  "--disable=all --enable=similarities". run only the similarities checker
#  "--disable=all --enable=classes --disable=W"
#  run only the classes checker, but have no Warning level messages displayed
